# Building a COVID-19 Face Mask Detection System using Simple CNN

In this project, we will explore the development of a COVID-19 face mask detection system using deep learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can classify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. We will utilize the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the Keras library to achieve this task. The dataset used for training and testing consists of images of individuals with and without face masks. Refer to -updating- for detailed guide.
